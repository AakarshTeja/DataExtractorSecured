            <h2>Intiation</h2>
            <p>Now a days it is becoming very difficult in industry to extract data like phone number and emails from documents
               like docs, pdfs. Consider an example of HR department in companies, there in companies they will have a large 
               number of resumes from candidates. It’s difficult for them to go through each and every file to get details 
               of the candidate. They may require candidates mails or phone numbers to get in contact with the candidates. 
               This gave us an idea of creating a service.
